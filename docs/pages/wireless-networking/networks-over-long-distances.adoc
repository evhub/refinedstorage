= Networks over long distances

Refined Storage supports 2 scenarios for long distance networking:

- xref:../viewing-resources/how-to-view-resources.adoc#_wireless_access[Viewing your resources wirelessly]
- Extending a network over a long distance without using cables (see below)

== The problem

Sometimes, you may have different areas all scattered throughout your world.

Here is the problem: you want access to your Refined Storage system on all of those areas.

You could lay xref:../networking/cable.adoc[] from your base to every area, but what if said area is 1000 blocks away?
Are you really going to craft 1000 xref:../networking/cable.adoc[cables]?
Didn't think so.

== The solution

Use the xref:network-transmitter.adoc[] and xref:network-receiver.adoc[].

Simply craft a xref:network-transmitter.adoc[] and connect it to your Refined Storage system in your main base.

Next up, craft a xref:network-card.adoc[].
I'll be telling what you need this for in a second, bear with me.

After crafting a xref:network-card.adoc[], craft a xref:network-receiver.adoc[] and place it in the area far away from your base. 

If the xref:network-receiver.adoc[] was added to an existing network, remove the xref:../networking/controller.adoc[] from that network, the receiver will act as a controller.

Take the xref:network-card.adoc[] and right click it on the xref:network-receiver.adoc[].

Put the xref:network-card.adoc[] in the xref:network-transmitter.adoc[] so the xref:network-transmitter.adoc[] knows where to send a signal to.

And now you are done.
Simply connect machines to your xref:network-receiver.adoc[] according to the normal machine connecting rules.

I suppose you could treat the xref:network-receiver.adoc[] as a xref:...

== One very important thing to note

The xref:../networking/controller.adoc[] in your main base and the xref:network-receiver.adoc[] in the other area **both** have to be chunkloaded **before** linking it to the network.

After linking, both areas have to stay chunkloaded.

== Using Refined Storage v1.7.x or v1.8.x?

Cross dimensional functionality isn't available in this version.
